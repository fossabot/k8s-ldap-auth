# K8s-ldap-auth Helm Repository

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.
Please refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started.

Once Helm is set up properly, add the repo as follows:

```console
$ helm repo add k8s-ldap-auth https://vbouchaud.github.io/k8s-ldap-auth/
```

You can then run `helm search repo` to see the charts.

For more details on installing k8s-ldap-auth please see the [chart readme](https://github.com/vbouchaud/k8s-ldap-auth/blob/master/distribution/kubernetes/charts/k8s-ldap-auth/README.md).
